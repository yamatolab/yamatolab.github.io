Biography
---------
Takahisa Yamato, Dr. Sc., was born in Mie, Japan. He studied physics and chemistry at Kyoto University, Japan, and received his BS and MS degrees in 1989 and 1991, respectively. At Kyoto University he carried out research on conformational dynamics of proteins with Nobuhiro Go and received his Dr. Sc. in chemistry from Kyoto University in 1994. In 1993–1997, he held a faculty position as an assistant professor at Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Japan. In 1997 he joined the physics department at Nagoya University, Japan, where he is currently Associate Professor of Theoretical Biophysics. At Nagoya University he carried out computational work of photoreceptor proteins with Toshiaki Kakitani. He has enjoyed visiting faculty appointments at National Institute for Material Sciences, Japan, in 2001; at Center for Integrative Bioscience, Okazaki National Institute, Japan, in 2002–2004; and at Baylor College of Medicine, USA, in 2009–2010. He served as a Steering Committee member, Biophysical Society of Japan, in 1999–2001 and 2005–2007. His major research interests in the field of theoretical and computational biophysics include the electron transfer and vibrational energy transfer in biological systems, and photosignal transduction and energy conversion of photoreceptor proteins.
